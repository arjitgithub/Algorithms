Given an integer n. Print first n elements of Recamanâ€™s sequence.
Examples:


Input : n = 6
Output : 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7

Input  : n = 17
Output : 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 21,
         11, 22, 10, 23, 9, 24, 8
It is basically a function with domain and co-domain as natural numbers and 0. It is recursively defined as below:
Specifically, let a(n) denote the (n+1)-th term. (0 is already there).
The rule says:

a(0) = 0,
if n > 0 and the number is not
   already included in the sequence,
     a(n) = a(n - 1) - n
else
     a(n) = a(n-1) + n.


Below is a simple implementation where we store all n Recaman Sequence numbers in an array.
We compute the next number using the recursive formula mentioned above.

Time Complexity : O(n2) 
Auxiliary Space : O(n), since n extra space has been added
Optimizations :   We can use hashing to store previously computed values and can make this 
program work in O(n) time.
